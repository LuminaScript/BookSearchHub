This is a trial implementation with Java for building the basic distributed system skeleton.

1. Cluster Co-ordination Service and Distributed Algorithms:

  LeaderElection: is a simple leader-election mechanism for selecting the leader
  WatcherDemo: is a demo class to demonstrate watcher mechanism work
  LeaderReelection: combine LeaderElection and and watcher class and added LeaderRe-election mecahanism to hanlde leader failure.
